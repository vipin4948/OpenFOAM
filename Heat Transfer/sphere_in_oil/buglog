some problem with T field ..temperature changes are not visible in results
heat transfer coefficient varies slowly ..so runnig for another 100 s
- after runnging the settings upto 100s the simulation still fails to generate the temperature field
-going through snappyhexamesh it found that the mesh rfignment region fails
as next step trying to run simulation without refignment box
